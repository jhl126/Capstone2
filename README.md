# Predicting and Analyzing Telecom Churn Rates

Analysis of [Telecom Customer Churn Rates] (https://www.kaggle.com/zagarsuren/telecom-churn-dataset-ibm-watson-analytics) with data collected by IBM Watson Analytics. 

This project was utilized as one of my capstone projects I submitted for Thinkful's Data Science Bootcamp curriculum. The time frame given to complete this project was roughly around one week. As a result of having extra time to complete the project, I was able to perform multiple different feature engineering techniques on the dataset (SelectKBest with K = 10, K = 15, and also Principle Component Analysis).
